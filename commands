Commands Explanation
This file provides an explanation of the key commands used in the System Health Monitoring Script (sys_health.sh), which checks CPU, memory, disk usage, and lists top CPU-consuming processes on a Windows system.

1. cmd.exe /c "wmic cpu get loadpercentage"
Purpose: Retrieves the CPU load percentage (current CPU usage).
Explanation:
cmd.exe: This runs the Command Prompt (cmd) on a Windows system.
/c: This argument tells Command Prompt to execute the command that follows it and then terminate.
"wmic cpu get loadpercentage": This command uses WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line) to fetch the CPU usage in percentage.
awk 'NR==2 {print $1}': This awk command filters out the first line (header) and gets the CPU load percentage from the second line.
2. cmd.exe /c "wmic OS get FreePhysicalMemory,TotalVisibleMemorySize"
Purpose: Retrieves the free and total physical memory (RAM) available on the system.
Explanation:
cmd.exe: Executes the Command Prompt (cmd) on Windows.
/c: Tells Command Prompt to execute the command that follows it.
"wmic OS get FreePhysicalMemory,TotalVisibleMemorySize": Uses WMIC to get memory details like the total visible memory and free physical memory.
awk '{print $2}' and awk '{print $1}': These commands use awk to extract the second column (total memory) and first column (free memory) from the output.
3. cmd.exe /c "wmic logicaldisk get size,freespace,caption"
Purpose: Retrieves information about disk size, free space, and disk drive caption.
Explanation:
cmd.exe: Executes the Command Prompt (cmd).
/c: Tells Command Prompt to run the following command.
"wmic logicaldisk get size,freespace,caption": Uses WMIC to fetch disk information like total disk size, free space, and disk caption (i.e., drive letter or name).
awk '{print $2}' and awk '{print $1}': Extracts the disk size and free space details using awk.
4. cmd.exe /c "tasklist /fo csv"
Purpose: Lists all running processes with their resource usage in CSV format.
Explanation:
cmd.exe: Runs Command Prompt (cmd) in Windows.
/c: Executes the given command and then terminates the session.
"tasklist /fo csv": Uses tasklist to list all running processes in a CSV (Comma Separated Values) format. This includes information such as memory usage, process name, and more.
head -6: Limits the output to the top 5 processes (the first 6 lines of CSV data, including the header).
5. echo "$(date): <message>" >> $LOGFILE
Purpose: Logs messages to a file with a timestamp.
Explanation:
$(date): This command gets the current date and time when the script is executed.
echo "<message>": Prints the specified message (e.g., CPU, memory usage).
>> $LOGFILE: Appends the message to the log file specified by $LOGFILE (i.e., sys_health.log).
6. awk 'NR==2 {print $1}'
Purpose: Filters and extracts specific columns from command output.
Explanation:
awk: This is a text-processing tool that allows you to manipulate and extract columns from a data stream.
NR==2: Refers to the second line in the output. NR is the line number.
{print $1}: Prints the first field (column) of the second line. For example, in CPU usage, it prints the value of load percentage.
7. head -6
Purpose: Displays the first 6 lines of input.
Explanation:
head: A command used to display the top lines of a file or output.
-6: This flag limits the output to the first 6 lines, which includes the top 5 CPU-consuming processes and the header.
